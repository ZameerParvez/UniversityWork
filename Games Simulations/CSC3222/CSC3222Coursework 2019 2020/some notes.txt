- collision detection is present
    - it hasn't been applied to tiles yet but the class and methods to add them to tiles has been implemented
        - there are 3 types of tiles
            - dampening
            - impassable
            - interactive

    - There is a bug where multiple robots are colliding with eachother when they should'nt
        - I think it might be because an object isn't being refernenced correctly

- Some extra map info is being stored
    - the building locations and their "doors"
    - the robot spawn tiles
    - player spawn tiles
        - any door infront of a red house

- character animations are fixed so that they stay in the direction you face

- the physics is using a fixed time step

- there are functions to tell what type of object te rigid body is

- collision volumes can reference a vvector of other collision volumes
    - this is so collision detection can be extended to heirarchical collisions
